  field=Description "^(?<TaskID>[^-]+).*" 
  Combine the results from a main search with the results from a subsearch search vendors. The result sets are joined on the product_id field, which is common to both sources.

... | join product_id [search vendors]


  
Module 1: (basics of Splunk User) 
=========  
Splunk Search Terms: 
    Keywords, Booleans, Phrases, Fields, Wildcards, Comparisons 
    Booleans AND OR NOT (uppercase) 
    Transforming commands(Top Rare Stats) 
    Dedup --> command removes results with duplicate field values. 

Module 2: (Beyond Search Fundamentals) 
========= 
Case sensitivity 
     Search terms, command names, clauses and functions are not case sensitive. 
     If a command references a specific value, that value will be case sensitive. 
     Field names are case sensitive and field values are not 
     Field values from a Lookup are case sensitive by default 
     When searhing uses tag, tag values should be case sensitive.
     User with an Admin mode can choose values to be case sensitie when creating lookup tables 
     Boolean operatores are case sensitive(Upper Case) 

Why Time:
     Time is the most efficient way filter in splunk
     when Splunk indexes data that data will store in bucket
     Buckets are directories containing set of raw data and indexing data.
     Buckets have configurable:
		maximum size and maximum time span  (by admin users)
     Three types of Buckets
        1) Hot: As events are indexed they are placed in hot.
		hot buckets are only writeable buckets
	2) Warm: hot buckets rolls to warm buckets when 
			maximum size reached
			Time span reached
			Indexer is restarted
                 Upon rolling, bucket is closed, renamed and changed to "read only" 
                 renamed: db_1389230491_1389230488_5
             1389230491(youngest event) and 1389230488(oldest event) in bucket.
         3) Cold: Warm buckets rolls to cold bucket when 
			maximum size reached
			Time span reached
          cold buckets are typically stored in differt locations than hot and warm buckets
          This allows to be stored in slower, cost effective infrastructure
      Distribution of buckets is more important in splunk search
      When splunk searches, it used timestamp on splunk directory and opens bucket directory
         and compressed the raw data according to splunk search
      Bucket names in Splunk indexes are used to:
		determine if the bucket should be searched based on the time range of the search

Wildcards:
      Wildcards are tested after all other search terms
      Only trailing wildcardsmake efficient use of index
      Wildcards at the beginning of a string cause splunk to search all events within timeframe
		causing performance issue
      Wildcards in the middle of a string produces inconsistent results
      Avoid using wildcards to match punctuation
      Be as specific as possible in search terms


Search Modes: (makes searches more efficient)
1)      Fast: emphasis performance only returning essential data
	(Non Transforming Search: only fields required for the search are extracted and displayed.
          Statistics and visualizations are not available.
          only events and patterns are available)
         (Transforming commands: have access to only statistics and visualization)
2)      Verbose: emphasis completeness (returns all field and event data)
	 (Non Transforming Search:events and patterns all fields of events are extracted)
	 (Transforming commands: events, patterns, Statistics and visualizations)
	Searching in verbose mode results in longer search times
3)	Smart: is desinged to give best results for the search running using combination of both fast and verbose mode.
          (Non Transforming Search: verbose mode)
	  (Transforming commands: Fast)

Best Practices:
	The less data you have to search, the faster splunk will be.
        Time is the most efficient filter, after time, index, source, host and sourcetype are most popular
	Fields extracted at index time do not need to be extracted for each search.
        More you tell the search engiene, more likely it is that you will get good results.

Job Inspector:(inspect job --> job menu)
	Determines which phase of a search takes the most time.
	Dissects behavior of searches to help understood costs.
	Any search job that has not expired can be inspected
		inspect job --> job menu

3rd Module:(Commands for visualization)
===========
Visualization Intro
	Any search that returns statistical values can be viewed as a chart
        Splunk includes reporting commands that help us to create tables specifically for visualiztion purpose

Chat Command:
	If a search returns statistics it can be viewed as a chart.
	contains two clause statements (over and by)
	Over clause tells splunk which field you want to be on the X asis	
	Any stats function can be applied to the chart command

		sourcetype=access status>299
		| chart count over status by host (only value can be specified after by clause)
				usernull=f (to remove null columns to chart
        Chart command by default limited to 10 columns others can be included by limit column
	useother=f to remove OTHER column in result/chart.
	The over clause allows you to define which field is represented on the X axis of a chart.

TimeChart command:
	Performs stats aggregations over time
	Time is always the X axis.

		sourcetype=vendor_sales
		| timechart count by poduct_name  (limit option available)
	timechart command intellegently clusters data in time intervals depend on the time selected
		sourcetype=vendor_sales
		| timechart span=12hr count by poduct_name  (limit option available)
       span to change clustered data time

Visualization examples:
	Format option in visualization
		General, X-Axis,Y-axis,Chart Overlay, Legend

Commands for visualization
	1) top/rare: if we want to count the frequency for fileds
	2) stats: to caluculate the statisticts b/w two or more fields when we do not need the data to be time based
	3) chart:to caluculate the statisticts b/w two or more fields with an arbitarty filed used in X-axis that is not time
		using by modififer each columns represent distinct values by splitting by
	4) timchart: if you need calculate statistic using time field. It will also allow by modifier

Module 4:
=========
Commands to pull geographic data from your machine data. Visualization to display data is easy to understand

iplocation command:
	is used to lookup and add location information to events
	Search city, country, region, latitude and longitude added to events include external ip addresses

	sourcetype=linux_secure action=success src_ip!=10.*
	| iplocation src_ip  
	(location fields created by iplocation fields is include fields that will be used for geostats command for mapping
	
Geostats command:
	aggreagates geographical data for use on a map visualization.
	sourcetype=vendor_sales
	| geostats latfield=Vendorlatitude longfield=VendorLongitutude 
	count by product_name globallimit=10

	geostats with iplocation:
        sourcetype=linux_secure action=success src_ip!=10.*
	| iplocation src_ip
	| geostats latfield=lat longfield=lon count

Choropleth Map:
	is another way to see our data in geographical visualization
	in order to use this we need .kmz(compressed keyhole markup launguage file)
	splunk ships with two kmz files
		geo_us_states.kmz
		geo_countries.kmz
	Geom command:
		Adds field with geographical data structures matching ploygons on map
	sourcetpe=vend* vendorID>=5000 AND vendorID<=5055
	| stats count as Sales by VendorCountry
	| geom geo_countries featureIdField=vendorCountry
	(geo_countries is feature collection)

Single value visualizations:
	single value and guages

	sourcetpe=vend* vendorID>=5000 AND vendorID<=5055
	| stats sum(price) as total
	| guage total 0 3000 6000 7000
	(gauge command to set ranges)

Trendline Command:
	Computes moving averages of field values

	sourcetype=access-combined action=purchase
	| timechart sum(price) as sales
	| trendline wma2(sales) as trend

	trend type 1) simple moving average(sma)
		   2) exponential moving average(ema)
		   30 weighted moving average(wma0
	Time period b/w 2 and 10000
	Field

Field Format:
	Format link in statistics tab

Addtotals command:
	Computes the sum of all numeric fields for each event

	sourcetpe=vend* vendorID>=5000 AND vendorID<=5055
	| chart sum(bytes) over host by file
	| addtotals col=true label="Total" labelfield="host"
	fieldname="Total by host"

       col = true --> to create summary column
       label = "Total"  --> label name in labelfield value

Module 5:
========
Eval Command:
	is used to caluculate and manipulate field values
	Arithmatic, concatination, boolean operartors supported
	Results can be written to new field or replace existing field
	newly crearted values are case sensitive
	eg: we can use eval to convert bytes to MG
	mathematical operations
	
Fieldformat command:
	Fomrat values without changing characteristics of underlying values
	uses same function as eval command

While eval creates new field values, the underlying data in the index does not change

Multiple eval commands:
	Eval commands can reference the results of the eval commands that come before it

Never use where command when you can filter by search terms

Module 6:
Correlating events:
Transaction:
	Any group of related events that span time
	Each event represents a user generating a single http request

Transaction command:
	transaction field-list (one or list)
	definations:
	   maxspam: Allows setting of maximum total time between earlist and latest events
	   maxspan: Allows maximum total time between events
	   startswith: Allows forming transactions starting with specified terms, field values, evaluations
           endswith: Allows forming transactions ending with specified terms, field values, evaluations
	   maxpause Finds groups of events where the span of time between included events does not exceed a specific value

Which of these is NOT a field that is automatically created with the transaction command? maxcount

Use Stats to see results of a calculation, or group events on a field value. 
Use Transaction to see events correlated together, or grouped by start and end values.

Module 7:
=======
Knowledge habits:
Naming Convention:
	OPS_WFA_Network_Security_na_IPwhoisAction
	group__type_platform_category_Time_Description

Module 8:
Field Extractions;
=================
      Utility allows us to use a graphical user interface
      to extract fields that persist as knowledge objects making them resuable in searches
      
How many ways are there to access the Field Extractor Utility? 3
Once a field is created using the regex method, you cannot modify the underlying regular expression. false
In the Field Extractor Utility, this button will display events that do not contain extracted fields. Non-Matchers
When extracting fields, we may choose to use our own regular expressions true

Module 9:
Aliases and calc fields:
Field aliases:
Calculated fields must be based on extracted or discovered fields
Fields from a lookup table or generated from a search command cannot be used.
Once a field alias is created: You can still use the original field name to search
Field aliases can only be applied to a single source type, source, or host. false
Field aliases are used to normalize data.
Calculated fields are based on underlying: eval expressions
Calculated fields are based on underlying: false

Module 10:
Tags and Event Types:
These allow you to categorize events based on search terms. event types
Which search would limit an "alert" tag to the "host" field?  tag::host=alert
Tags are descriptive names for key value pairs
Event Types do not show up in the Fields List. false
You can only add one tag per field value pair. false

Module 11:
macros:
  Reusable search strings or portions of search strings
  useful for frequent searches with complicated search syntax
  macors allow to store entire search stings
                  Time range independent
	          pass argument to search

Search macros:
What is the correct way to name a macro with two arguments?us_sales(2)
The number of arguments in a macro must be included in the macro name. true

Module12:
WorkFlow Actions
     create links to interact with external resources or narrow search

Get Method
Post metod

A Workflow action can:
	Send field values to external sources.
	Direct users to a specified URI.
	/Execute a secondary search.
This Workflow Action type sends field values to external resources. POST
To use field value data from an event in a Workflow Action, we need to: Wrap the field in dollar signs.
Workflow Actions can only be applied to a single field. FALSE
This Workflow Action type directs users to a specified URI. get

mODULE 13:
Data models
	Events Searches transactions  (Root event)
Root Data Model:
        Datasets --> Root Event/Root Search/Root transaction/child
	Root Event enables us to create hierardhies based on a set of events, and are the most commanly used type of root data model object.
	Root Search builds these hierarchies from a transforming search.
	Root Search do not benifit from data model accelaraiton
        avoid root searches whenever possible.
        Root transaction objects allow us to create datasets from groups of related events that span time. They use an existing object from our data hierarchy to group on.
	Child objects allos us to constrain or narrow down the evetns in the object above it in hierarchy tree.
     
Using transactions:
        Transactions with datasets
		do not benifit from data modek accelaration(think about the reports users will be running)
